# 📐 Permutation Calculator (nPr) – Java Console Application

This is a simple Java program that calculates permutations using the formula:

nPr = n! / (n - r)!


It takes user input for the total number of terms (`n`) and the number of selected terms (`r`), then calculates and displays the result.

## 💻 How It Works

1. Prompts the user to enter the total number of terms (`n`)
2. Prompts the user to enter the number of selections (`r`)
3. Calculates the permutation (nPr)
4. Displays the result

### 📥 Sample Console Input:
enter the terms :
5
enter the selection :
3
